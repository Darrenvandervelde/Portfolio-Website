## Description

My Portfolio Website is a personal web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a developer.  
The motivation behind this project was to create a central, accessible platform where recruiters, collaborators, and peers can quickly understand who I am and what I can do.

This website solves the problem of fragmented project presentation by bringing my work, GitHub activity, and contact information into one clean, user-friendly interface.  
Through building this project, I strengthened my understanding of responsive design, modern UI/UX principles, and structuring scalable front-end code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
